R code to track my weight and blood pressure

This repo is not intended for public consumption. This is just a collection of code 
where I am trying to figure out and explore the the Apple Health Export. It also is
where I did earlier work with spreadsheet-based data on the history of my weight for 20+
years and also a couple of years of blodd pressure readings.

My [blog](https://www.johngoldin.com) will have some posts on the Apple Health Export and
already has a post on
the [20+ year history of daily weight](https://www.johngoldin.com/post/2017-02-26-narcissism-in-r/).
